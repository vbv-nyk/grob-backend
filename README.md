        ## Installation

        1. Clone the repository:
           ````bash
              git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-challenge-app.git
                 cd game-challenge-app
                 ```
           ````

2. Install dependencies:

   ````bash
      npm install
         ```

         3. Set up MongoDB (using in-memory MongoDB for tests):
            The application uses [MongoMemoryServer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server) for running tests with an in-memory database.

            4. Run the application:
               ```bash
                  npm start
                     ```

                     ## Usage

                     This application exposes the following routes for interacting with the game:

                     ### Game Routes

                     - **`GET /game/start`**
                       Starts a new game by returning 10 random destinations with options (clue, fun fact, and possible cities).

                       - **`POST /game/submit-answer`**
                         Submits the player's answer. It expects `questionId` (destination ID) and `selectedCity` (the city guessed by the player). Returns whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

                         ### Challenge Routes

                         - **`POST /challenge/create`**
                           Creates a new challenge. The request body should contain a `username`, a set of `questions`, and a `score`. The username is stored in a `Username` model.

                           - **`GET /challenge/:challengeId`**
                             Retrieves the details of an existing challenge by its ID.
