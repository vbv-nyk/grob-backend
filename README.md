        ## Installation

        1. Clone the repository:
           ````bash
              git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-challenge-app.git
                 cd game-challenge-app
                 ```
           ````

2. Install dependencies:

   ````bash
      npm install
         ```

         3. Set up MongoDB (using in-memory MongoDB for tests):
            The application uses [MongoMemoryServer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server) for running tests with an in-memory database.

            4. Run the application:
               ```bash
                  npm start
## Testing

### Test Setup

The tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), and [MongoMemoryServer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-memory-server) to run MongoDB in-memory for testing purposes.

1. Install testing dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest mongodb-memory-server
```

2. To run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Test Files

#### Game Routes Tests
- **File**: `game.test.ts`
- **Testing Libraries**: `jest`, `supertest`
- **Key Tests**:
- `GET /game/start`: Tests returning 10 random destinations.
- `POST /game/submit-answer`: Tests for both correct and incorrect answers.

#### Challenge Routes Tests
- **File**: `challenge.test.ts`
- **Testing Libraries**: `jest`, `supertest`
- **Key Tests**:
- `POST /challenge/create`: Tests challenge creation.
- `GET /challenge/:challengeId`: Tests retrieving a challenge by ID.

These test files are structured to check basic functionality such as ensuring correct answers, handling invalid requests, and simulating server errors.

Certainly! Here's a section you can add to your `README.md` to explain the Swagger setup and usage in your project:

```markdown
## Swagger Documentation

Swagger provides interactive API documentation for your Express application. It allows you to explore and test API endpoints directly from the browser.

### Setting up Swagger

1. **Install Swagger dependencies**:
   To integrate Swagger with your Express app, you need to install `swagger-ui-express` and `swagger-jsdoc`.

   ```bash
   npm install swagger-ui-express swagger-jsdoc
   ```

2. **Configure Swager in your application**:
   Add the following code to your main application file (usually `app.js` or `server.js`).

3. **Access the Swagger UI**:
After setting up the above code, you can access the interactive API documentation at the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

The swagger docs in production can be found at:

```
https://reportease.ddns.net:3000/docs/
```

### API Documentation Structure

Swagger will automatically generate documentation for your routes and models based on JSDoc comments in your code. Each API endpoint should include comments to describe the request and response format.

### Key Sections in the `README.md`:
1. **Installation**: Describes the setup and dependencies required.
2. **Usage**: Explains the core features and the API endpoints.
3. **Testing**: Details the testing framework used, how to run tests, and includes an example of the test files.
4. **License**: A placeholder for the project's license information.
